        +"""was published in 2001, and has inspired a number of new software development methodologies.
            Now, nearly all software development shops claim to be agile to some degree.
            However, in almost every organization which attempts to adopt it,
            the implementation falls short of the promise offered by the approach.
            A whole industry of consultants and speakers have emerged trying to pin down how companies can implement agile correctly,
            yet still, it almost never works.
            Even the authors of the manifesto seem consistently frustrated and confused by the refusal of companies to internalize the principles of agile software development.
            This may be due to a mass misunderstanding of what the Agile Manifesto really means.
            Although it explicitly critiques the specific methods of waterfall-style development,
            the criticisms are implicitly critiquing something deeper.

        +"""The discussion about the failures of Agile has been far-reaching,
            but some of the Manifesto signatories have termed phrases such as "Dark Agile" or "Flaccid Agile"
            to describe attempted implementations of Agile which fail to live up to the ideals of the manifesto.
            However, most analyses of Agile failure ultimately trace the failure back to a lack of buy-in.
            It is universally recognized that agile only works if you have buy-in across the entire organization, all the way to the top.
            This level of buy-in is almost never achieved, and this is usually what is blamed for the failings of Agile.
            Most people assume, people don't buy into Agile, because they just don't truly understand it, and fail to internalize it.
            But the reason may actually be that management """
        em { +"does" }
        +""" understand what it is, and rejects it outright.
            At the same time, developers mis-understand it, and therefore don't grasp why management refuses to buy in.

        This all adds up to a concept known as "Alienation".
        The theoretical basis of alienation within the capitalist mode of production is that the worker invariably loses the ability to determine life and destiny when deprived of the right to think (conceive) of themselves as the director of their own actions; to determine the character of said actions; to define relationships with other people; and to own those items of value from goods and services, produced by their own labour. Although the worker is an autonomous, self-realized human being, as an economic entity this worker is directed to goals and diverted to activities that are dictated by the bourgeoisie—who own the means of production—in order to extract from the worker the maximum amount of surplus value in the course of business competition among industrialists.
